This dashboard explores perceptions of convenience and comfortability in access to sexual and reproductive health resources.

Data was obtained through _Just In Case_, a student-led, grassroots health promotion strategy carried out at the University of Minnesota Rochester (UMR). This strategy is part of a larger grassroots and mutual-aid initiative between faculty and undergraduate students working together to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of undergraduates attending post-secondary settings with limited access to sexual and reproductive health resources by providing and increasing access to comprehensive, evidence-based, and sex-positive resources and tools.

The dashboard consists of three pages exploring the following:

- **Home**: Demographics of Just In Case users.
- **Convenience**: perceptions of convenience of accessing sexual and reproductive health resources across demographic groups.
- **Comfortability**: self-reported measures of comfort in accessing sexual and reproductive health resources across demographic groups.

All code for creating the dashboard can be found in `dashboard.qmd`.
_This dashboard was created by Joann Le and Shelby Tisdale as part of a hackathon for the 2024 Equitable Data Science REU at the University of Minnesota._
